## From A to Z in Rephrasing Chemistry

Hey you ! ðŸ«µðŸ˜Ž In this repo follow the notebook to go from xml containing data from extracted papers to a dataset that can then be rephrased thanks to whatever model you chose on either Slurm or Runai job schedulers to generate a LOT of data !

Morevover, there's a .ipynb attempting different things based off the [Fractal Patterns May Illuminate the Success of Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01825) paper in a subdirectory to play around with !
 
Everything is in the notebook in this repo, simply download it and start !
